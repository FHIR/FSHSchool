## Migrating from pre-1.0.0 Projects

The SUSHI project structure and configuration changed significantly between pre-1.0.0 versions of SUSHI and versions of SUSHI 1.0.0 or greater. This guide will assume you currently have a project structure similar to the **customized ig** shown in the [project structure documentation](/docs/sushi/project/#ig-projects) for pre-1.0.0 versions of SUSHI. To migrate this project, the following changes are required:

#### 1 - Move config.yaml
Move the **customized-ig/fsh/config.yaml** file to the top-level of the **customized-ig** folder, and rename the file to **sushi-config.yaml**, so that the file is located at **customized-ig/sushi-config.yaml**.
#### 2 - Move .fsh files
Move all **.fsh** files within the **customized-ig/fsh** folder to a new folder, **customized-ig/input/fsh**.
#### 3 - Move ig-data Content
Move the contents of the **customized-ig/fsh/ig-data** folder to their corresponding location within the **customized-ig** folder. When moving these files, each file should be placed at a location under **customized-ig** that corresponds to the file's previous location under **ig-data**. So for example, if you had an **ig.ini** file at **customized-ig/fsh/ig-data/ig.ini**, that file should be moved to just **customized-ig/ig.ini**. If you had a **menu.xml** file at **customized-ig/fsh/ig-data/includes/menu.xml**, that file should be moved to **customized-ig/includes/menu.xml**.
#### 4 - Remove fsh/ Directory
At this point, all of the contents of the **customized-ig/fsh** folder should have been moved out of **customized-ig/fsh**, so that folder can be safely deleted.
#### 5 - Update Content of sushi-config.yaml
Update **sushi-config.yaml** to remove the `template` property if necessary. The `template` property is used by SUSHI to generate an **ig.ini** file, and its usage is now deprecated. The **ig.ini** file must be managed directly. If SUSHI detects usage of the `template` property to generate an **ig.ini** file, it will log an error message containing the **ig.ini** that would be generated by that `template` property. Copy these contents, and place them in an **ig.ini** file located at **customized-ig/ig.ini**.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
The **ig.ini** file MUST use the `#current` version of the `fhir.base.template` (or a template that extends this version). So to use the `fhir.base.template`, the `template` property in **ig.ini** will be `template = fhir.base.template#current`.
{{% /alert %}}

Update **sushi-config.yaml** to remove the `history` property if necessary. The `history` property is used by SUSHI to generate a **package-list.json** file, and its usage is now deprecated. Similar to `template` above, if SUSHI detects usage of the `history` property to generate a **package-list.json** file, it will log an error message containing the contents of the **package-list.json** that would be generated by the `history` property. Copy these contents and place them in a **package-list.json** file located at **customized-ig/package-list.json**.

#### 6 - Update Version Control
If you are using Git for version control, update your **.gitignore** file. In the example of **customized-ig**, the pre-migration **.gitignore** would have likely contained **ig.ini** and **package-list.json**, since those files were being generated by SUSHI, and the "true" versions were in the SUSHI configuration or **ig-data**. Now the versions that live at **customized-ig/ig.ini** and **customized-ig/package-list.json** are the "true" versions, and should therefore be removed from **.gitignore** and checked into version control. The **customized-ig/input** folder may have also been in the **.gitignore** file, since SUSHI previously generated output into that folder. Now that **.fsh** files are located in **customized-ig/input/fsh**, this folder must be removed from **.gitignore** and checked into version control.

SUSHI will now output to **customized-ig/fsh-generated**, so the **fsh-generated** folder should be added to the **.gitinore** file.
