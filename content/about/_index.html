{{% blocks/lead color="white"%}}
FHIR Shorthand (FSH) is a domain-specific language for defining the contents of FHIR Implementation Guides (IG). 
The language is specifically designed for this purpose, simple and compact, and allows the author to express their 
intent with fewer concerns about underlying FHIR mechanics. FSH can be created and updated using any text editor, 
and because it is text, it enables distributed, team-based development using source code control tools such as GitHub.
To get started with FSH try it out [online](http://standardhealthrecord.org/fsh-playground/) or get 
started with the [SUSHI Command Line Interface](/docs/sushi).
