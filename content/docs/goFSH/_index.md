This section contains documentation for GoFSH, which turns FHIR artifacts into FSH definitions. Using GoFSH, you can turn an existing FHIR Implementation Guide into a FSH project automatically.

If you are starting a project from scratch, see [Initializing a SUSHI Project](/docs/sushi/project/#initializing-a-sushi-project).
