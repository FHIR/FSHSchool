  This section contains the documentation for GoFSH, which turns FHIR artifacts into FSH definitions

Using GoFSH, you can turn an existing FHIR Implementation Guide into a FSH project automatically.

If you are starting a project from scratch, see [Initializing a SUSHI Project](/docs/sushi/project/#initializing-a-sushi-project).

For more information on FHIR, FSH, and SUSHI, please see the [documentation home page](/docs/).
