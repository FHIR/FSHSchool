Here you will find documentation on how to get started using FSH to create Implementation Guides. Head to [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) for
some background information on FSH and FHIR. If you're ready to start writing some FSH, go to [SUSHI](/docs/sushi) to learn about the SUSHI compiler for FSH.
If you want to dive right into creating an Implementation Guide, check out the [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) for full instructions on making an Implementation
Guide using FSH and SUSHI.
