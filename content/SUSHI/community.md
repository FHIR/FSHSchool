FHIR Shorthand and SUSHI are relatively young but already enjoy great communities! If you run into any issues developing IGs with FSH and SUSHI, you can reach out to the community in the following ways:

* Participate, ask, or answer questions on the Zulip [#shorthand](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand) stream.
* File a SUSHI bug report or feature request on the [SUSHI issue tracker](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/issues).
* File a FSH comment or suggestion on the [FHIR Jira](https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20FHIR%20AND%20Specification%20%3D%20%22Shorthand%20(FHIR)%20%5BFHIR-shorthand%5D%22).
